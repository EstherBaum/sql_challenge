Module 9 Challenge assignment

For this homework assignment we were given 6 csv files and given various tasks that were groups into Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis. 

First I created an Entity Relationships Diagram in QuickDBD and saved as 'QuickDBD-export.png'. Next I created tables in PostgreSQL, assigning primary keys, data types, and 'Not Null' Values', then I imported each of the CSV files into the tables. 

Then I performed various queries to get the information asked for in eight questions.
